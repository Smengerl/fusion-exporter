# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing to Auto GitHub Exporter! Contributions are welcome and appreciated. To make collaboration smooth, please follow these guidelines.

## How to contribute

1. Fork the repository and create a feature branch 
2. Make your changes in a clearly named branch (e.g., `fix/export-naming` or `feat/add-step-through-ui`).
3. Write clear commit messages and keep changes focused.
4. Open a Pull Request describing what you changed and why.

## Reporting issues

- Search existing issues before opening a new one.
- Provide clear steps to reproduce, expected vs actual behavior, and Fusion 360 version if relevant.

## Coding style

- Follow PEP8 for Python scripts where practical.
- Keep functions small and add comments for non-obvious logic.

## Testing

Because this is an add-in that runs inside Fusion 360, automated tests may be limited. Include manual testing steps in your PR description and screenshots where appropriate.
